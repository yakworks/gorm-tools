## Sub Projects



## Purpose 

Gorm-tools allows your Grails/Gorm project to start with a design of best practices that they can customize along the way. 
This brings an opinionated starting point to a Grails/Gorm project but without being locked in.
Developers are free to easily customize, replace and disable these patterns when their opinions differ.

## Overview

This is a library of tools to help standardize and simplify the service and Restful controller layer business logic for 
domains and is the basis for the [Gorm Rest API plugin](https://yakworks.github.io/gorm-rest-api/){.new-tab}. 

Gorm-Tools is the next iteration on the [DAO plugin](https://grails.org/plugin/dao) and has been in use for about 10 years processing millions of transactions per day.

There are 3 primary patterns this library enables as detailed below for Repositories,
Mango ( A mongo/graphql like query way to get gorm entity data with a Map) and
Batch or Bulk inserting and updating with data binding

## Domain Repository Services
<small>[jump to reference](docs/repository/ref.md)</small>

A repository is a [Domain Driven Design](docs/usefulLinks.md#references) pattern. Used a a place logic to validate, bind, persist and query data that resides 
either in a database or NoSql (via GORM usually of course).
The design pattern here is a bit similiar to [Spring's Repository pattern]
and Grails GORM's new [Data Services] pattern.

### Goals

* **Standardization**: a clean common pattern across our apps for domain service layer logic that 
  reduces boiler plate in both services as well as controllers.
* **Transactional Saves**: every save() or persist() is wrapped in a transaction if one doesn't already exist. 
  This is critical when there are cascading saves and updates.
* **RuntimeException Rollback by default**: saves or `persist()` always occur with failOnError:true so a RuntimeException is 
  thrown for both DataAccessExceptions as well a validation exceptions.
  This is critical for deeply nested domain logic dealing with saving multiple domains chains.
* **Events & Validation**: the Repository allows a central place to do events such as beforeSave, beforeValidate, etc 
  so as not to pollute the domain class. This pattern makes it easier to keeps the special logic in a transaction as well. 
  Allows validation outside of constraints to persistence without needing to modify the domain source.
* **Events with Flushing**: As mentioned in the Gorm docs, "Do not attempt to flush the session within an event 
  (such as with obj.save(flush:true)). Since events are fired during flushing this will cause a StackOverflowError.". 
  Putting the event business logic in the Repository keeps it all in a normal transaction and a flush is perfectly fine.  
* **Easy Override/Replace Plugin's Domain Logic**: Since the Repository is a service this also easily allows default logic in a provided 
  plugin to be overriden in an application. For example, I may have a CustomerRepo in a plugin that deals with deault common 
  logic to validate address. I can then implement a CustomerRepo in an application and it will override the spring bean
  just as it does for a service. 

## Fast Data Binder & Batch Insert/Update

We process millions of transactions per day and needed more performant binding performance.

### Goals

* **FAST Data Binding Service**: databinding from maps (and thus JSON) has to be fast. 
  We sacrfice a small amount of functionality for a big performance gain
  Maps and json are a first class citizen in the data service layer instead of the controller layer. 
  Eliminates boiler plate in getting data from the database to Gorm to JSON Map then back again.
* **Asynchronous batch processing PERFORMANCE**: GORM insert and updates can be chunked and processed in parrallel 
  using GPARS or RxJava making it easy to processes millions of records from JSON, CSV or Excel
  
## JSON Query and Filtering (Mango Query)

The primary motive here is to create an easy dynamic map based way to query any Gorm Datastore (SQL or NoSQL). 
Using a simple map that can come from json, yaml, groovy config etc... 
A huge motivating factor being able is to be able to have a powerful and flexible way to query using json from a REST 
based client without having to use *GraphQL* (the only other clean alternative)
The Repositories and RestApiController come with a `query(criteriaMap, closure)` method. It allows you to get a paginated 
list of entities restricted by the properties in the `criteriaMap`.

* A lot of inspiration was drawn from [Restdb.io]
* the query language is similar to [Mongo's]
* and CouchDB's new [Mango selector-syntax] .
* Also inspired by [json-sql]

> :memo: 
Whilst selectors have many similarities with MongoDB query documents, 
these arise more from a similarity of purpose and do not necessarily extend to commonality of function or result.

**Example**
for example, sending a JSON search param that looks like this

``` js
{
  "name": "Bill%",
  "type": "New",
  "age": {"$gt": 65}
}
```
would get converted to the equivalent criteria

```javascript
criteria.list {
    ilike "name", "Bill%"
    eq "type", "New"
    gt "age", 65
}
```

## Developer Notes

### Make

while gradle is the build tool behind spring/grails, make is used for consitency to run gradle
and use docker and setting up env for testing

run `make` to see help

run `make check` for full tests

or run `./gradlew check`

### Running docs locally

run make help for latest targets

`make docmark.start`

### Publishing Plugin Releases

See [Developer Docs](docs/developer.md) for info on our release process

**Using latests SNAPSHOT**  

Configure 9ci repo in build.gradle

```groovy
repositories {
  maven { url "http://repo.9ci.com/oss-snapshots" }
 }
```

See [version.properties](version.properties) for snapshot version

```groovy
dependencies {
 compile('org.grails.plugins:gorm-tools:x.y.z-SNAPSHOT') { changing = true } 
}
```
