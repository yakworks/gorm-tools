## The `openapi` folder

This folder contains the templates used by the nine.rcm.api.OapiGen to generate
the full api. 

Entry point template is api.yaml

To add static documents (e.g. Markdown) the document root is ```domain9/api-docs/eleventy/```.

For example, if you put a file ```domain9/api-docs/eleventy/more/sample.md``` then referencing it you
would use ```[see the sample here](more/sample)``` to reference it.
