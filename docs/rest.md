# Out of the box Restful API for grails.

This is a library and [Grails] plugin to enhance [Gorm] to provide and expose a somewhat _opinionated_, ==well documented restful API== with intelligent out of the box defaults and minimal tweaking. It also keeps it easy to configure and customize on the fly at a deployed client site without the need to recompile.

While its somewhat opinionated it frames out Rest best practices outlined in the [Rest Design Principles] section.  It uses the [OpenAPI] spec (formerly [Swagger]) as well as how it maps the Gorm domains into that spec. Its accepts and returns only JSON and eschews the complexity of XML

While REST is not CRUD a lot of it really is. This project aims to makes it easy and quick to setup the common use cases that are really just CRUD Controller over the [GORM] domains so you can focus on the unique business logic use cases that are hard.

**Key features and goals of this plugin include:**

- **The simple stuff should be simple and automatic**
- DRY : Don't repeat yourself.
- Autogenerated code is evil. This includes tests
- Use AST, traits and tanspiling where possible

---

- [ ] Near zero configuration to expose [Swagger] documented resources (the Gorm domains)
- [ ]  Rely on the domain's contraints as much as possible for configurations and docs.
- [ ]  Out of the box CRUD Controller modified from Grails [@Resource annotation and RestfulController] 
      that can delegate to transactional Services (Repositories, Data Services) flavored services based on naming 
      convention or configuration. Uses the [gorm-tools] plugin by deafault for this.
- [ ]  Custom schema selects for retruned JSON fields that can be confiugured at runtime by a customer (does not require recompiling views)
- [ ]  Consistent documented use of HTTP status codes and headers
- [ ]  Uses [cache-headers](https://github.com/grails-plugins/cache-headers) for faster loading
- [ ]  Use [Repository] pattern by defualt to keep the CRUD code in its own transactional service
- [ ]  Ability to 'query by POST' (to allow query criteria to be provided within the request body)
- [ ]  Intelligent defaults for security plugin with OATH and JWT.
- [ ]  Tools to ease GEB functional tests with Spock
- [ ]  Extensive regression tests

## JSON Generation

There are 3 ways to generate json.

1. using renderers, [Customizing Response Rendering](http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/REST.html#renderers)
2. using the [grails-views plugin](https://github.com/grails/grails-views/).
3. using JSON.ObjectMarshaller which seems to be out of favor in the docs and is not longer mentioned
but remains in the grails-plugin-converter's main [JSON].
[this is a good overview](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/Customizing-JSON-Grails-Object-Marshalling) 
and this for using [name config](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25573270/grails-2-4-named-configuration-for-json-not-working) 
with [unit testing example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24604747/how-do-i-unit-test-named-configurations-for-object-marshallers)

This [slide show](https://www.slideshare.net/clatimer/building-awesome-apis-in-grails)
is a must preview does a good job of explaining the different options towards the end.

The goal is to provide the fastest way to render and object or collection
that allows custom includes or excludes.

A `static includes = ...` can be set on the domain, the repository or the controller.
An gets overriden in that order. For example: if I set excludes on the domain
if I set in on a Repository CRUD controller for that domain the it uses that. A setting
in the AppSetupConfig overides them all and a includes param sent into the endpoint
will be used above all others.
I would be nice to put the grails-views into this picture as well so that if there is a `*.gson` file
it gets used. Will need to figure out the resolution order.

There is a way to register a name wigh JSON.createNamedConfig and then they can be used with `JSON.use(name){...}`
This might be something we want to look into as an option as it may be really easy to incorporate our AppSetupConfig.

DefaultRendererRegistry in org.grails.plugins.web.rest.render is where the defaults
aer registered.

## Setting up the domains

most of a rest api can be setup and documented with nothing more than just the domains

### @RestApi annotation
inspired by the Grails [@Resource annotation](provide link)
Adding this to your domains with create a controller using AST under the `api` namespace with common actions
and UrlMappings for a rest api. It uses a transactional Repository data service by default.

|    attribute    |                                                  desc                                                  |       default        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| description     | information to appear to a dev and in the Open api docs                                                | ""                   |
| endpoint        | if this annotation only for api docs and you don't want a controller generated then set this to false. | true                 |
| readOnly        | Whether this is a read-only endpoint (one that doesn't allow DELETE, POST, PUT or PATCH requests)      | false                |
| controllerClass | The Controller class to generate. Can be set to null to skip the generation                            | RestApiRepoController |

**Example**
```groovy
import gorm.restapi.RestApi

@RestApi(description = "The user for the restify application")
class AppUser {
```

see the section on the [RestApiRepoController](insert link here) for more details about the controller setup

### OpenAPI and json-schema

We use additional constraints on the domain to help with the json-schema and Open API docs as well as for DRY testing.

**added meta-contraints**
| contraints  |                                  desc                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| description | information to appear to a dev and in the Open api docs                 |
| title       | override the title. converts camel case to word with spaces by defaults |
| example     | used in docs as well as auto mocking out test data                      |

**Example**
```groovy
static constraints = {
    userName  description: 'The login name',
              title: 'Login Name',
              example:"billy1"
```

|    contraint    |   json-schema   |                notes                 |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| min             | minimum         |                                      |
| max             | maximum         |                                      |
| maxSize         | maxLength       |                                      |
| minSize         | minLength       |                                      |
| scale           | multipleOf      | = 1/Math.pow(10, constraints.scale)) |
| email           | format='email'  |                                      |
