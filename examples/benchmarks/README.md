## Overview

The application runs large batch inserts (115K records) in different ways. The goal is to decide the optimum way to run large batch inserts with Gorm.

The goal is to have good benchmarks to measure and answer the following questions.

- Fastest way to persist/insert large batches of JSON or CSV data using gorm.
- How big are the advantages of using multi-core.
- Does Data Binding slow it down? How much faster is it to use plain old school setters?
- Does validation slow it down?
- Does @CompileStatic and @GrailsCompileStatic speed things up on domains, setters methods, etc..? Where should it be used and what are the impacts?
- When using Traits to build domains classes is there an impact on performance.
- Do associations slow inserts and updates down?
- Does AuditTrail's Auditstamp slow it down, can it be optimized
- Does Repositories slow it down
- Do custom Id generator slow it down, or improve speed

**The key conclusions are..**

- Use @CompileStatic and @GrailsCompileStatic everywhere as it has the one of the biggest impacts in performance improvements
- Use Async/Gpars batch insert/updates is the optimum way to do large batch inserts 
  and is the other biggest impact on performance improvement.
- use small transaction batches whenever possbile (100-255 items) and keep them the same size as the jdbc.batch_size. DO NOT (auto)commit on every insert
- Use Gorm-Tools fast Databinding. The stock Grails databinding has BIG (10-20x slower) performance penalty and an even bigger hit when using Traits for fields on the domain.
   See [grails issue #10862](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/10862)
- Inserting each record in separate transaction or flushing on each items has a  performance penalty and should be avoided when updating or inserting data.
- Disabling validation improves performance slightly and performs well eg. ```domain.save(false)```
- Grails Date stamp fields has a negligible effect on performance.
- AuditTrail has a negligible effect on performance.
- Repo does not have any major noticable effect on performance.
- Using custom [idgenerator](https://yakworks.github.io/gorm-tools/id-generation/) improves saves by up to 50% over auto/native
   as it allows hibernate to use the jdbc.batch_size.
- Using listeners and grails @Listener events can slow it down by 20-50%. 
  With our specs about 3 seconds for synchronous single thread processing 100k+ records.
  which drops to <1 second when doing the same thing asyncronously (gpars parralel batches)
- set grails.gorm.autowire=false, its about 10% faster for saving. 

### Running the benchmarks

- There is a script ```run-benchmarks.sh``` which will run the benchmarks
- Run ```./run-benchmarks.sh``` or `gradle assemble; java -server -jar -DmultiplyData=3 -Dgorm.tools.async.poolSize=1 build/libs/benchmarks.war`
- **multiplyData** multiplies the base 36k City record set. so setting it to 3 will process 3 x 36k=118k rows.

By default benchmarks uses default gpars pool size which is (availableProcessors + 1) which can be modified by passing system property

- **gorm.tools.async.poolSize** 1 for single thread, set to 5 if you have a 4 core processor (even if its 8 cores with hyperhreading), 9 for 8 cores, etc..

## Batch or Bulk Data Inserts with large datasets

Its assumed that the performance benefits are already understood of batching large datasets for bulk inserting and updating. 
that setting `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` to around 50 or 100 
and `grails.gorm.flushMode=COMMIT` ( the default now in Gorm 6.1.x) to avoid flushing. 
```
//THE REALLY BAD SLOW PAINFUL WAY
def saveBigData(List reallyLargeData) {
    reallyLargeData.each { item ->
        Foo foo = new Foo()
        foo.bar = item.bar
        foo.save(flush: true, failOnError: true)
  }
}
```

```
//The Best way
def saveBigData(List reallyLargeData) {
    //collate the reallyLargeData into batch(chunks) of lists. batchSize can equal the jdbc.batch_size
    List<List> collatedList = reallyLargeData.collate(batchSize)
    collatedList.each { batchList ->
        saveBatchChunk(batchList)
    }
}
@Transactional
void saveBatchChunk(List smallerData){
    batchList.each { item ->
        Foo foo = new Foo()
        foo.bar = item.bar
        foo.save(flush: true, failOnError: true)
    }
    //or inject the hibernateDatastore
    Session session = GormEnhancer.findStaticApi(domainClass).datastore.currentSession
    session.clear() //clear the cache
}
```

The latter is essentially what the `save batch` is doing below.

### CityFatBenchInsert Benchmarks

Goals: 
* compare Domains with @CompileStatic vs letting it be dynamic
* static and dynamic compiled setters vs fast EntityMapBinder
* Gorm-tools binder vs Grails binder
* asyncronous saving vs single thread


- **setters static, no assocs** - Uses the [CityFatNoTraitsNoAssoc] with no associations and does not use Traits.
  staticically compiled method with plain old setters are used as can be seen in the domain.
- **setters static**  - uses statically compiled setters to populate the domain. marked with `@CompileStatic`
- **setters dynamic**  - uses dynamically compiled setters to populate the domain. marked with `@CompileDynamic`
- **gorm-tools: repository batch** - uses the gorm-tools repository's batchCreate
	which in turn uses the fast EntityMapBinder to bind the json data and the repository methods
 	to create persist. Uses defaults with all events enabled.
- **gorm-tools: fast binder & persist** - uses the repo bind method and then persists
- **Grails default DataBinder, No Traits** - this benchmark uses the "out of the box"
	binder in grails with [CityFatNoTraits] which is statically compiled.
  basically what you get when you do `someDomain.properties = jsonData`.
	Its only run with the "create" and "validate" methods as its sufficient to show that its much slower.
- **Grails DataBinder w/Traits** - this benchmark uses the "out of the box"
	binder in grails with [CityFat] like the others.
  Its only run with the "create" method as its sufficient to show that its
	much slower and an issue has been filed for performance problems.

**column data and action descriptions**

- **Domain @Compile** - when it static its using the [CityFat] domain that
	had @CompileStatic or @GrailsCompileStatic and when its dynamic its using
	the [CityFatDynamic] which is dynamicaly compiled ( not marked with GrailsCompileStatic).
- **create** - creates a new instance and sets or binds the json data
	depending on the benchmark type. The 'setters ..' benchmarks will use setters,
	the others use either gorm-tools databinding or grails etc..
- **validate** - does the create and also calls `validate()` for each item
- **save batch** - see the examples. uses the the jdb_batch size(default of 100)
	and "chunks" or batches the saves. calls flush() after each batch of 100
	is inserted and calls clear() to empty the hibernate/gorm cache
- **save async** - Uses the gorm-tools helper bean [AsyncSupport]
	which uses gpars by default. This also chunks or batches the inserts
  asynchronously using a pool size of 5 threads by default.
	essentially collates the List of items from json into a list of lists(or batches)
  and fires each batch into it own thread to run.

### Batching inserts and updates with hibernate
JDBC API supports batching for DML operations, however by default Hibernate does not use JDBC batching support. Below are the settings which can be used to enable batching of insert/updates with hibernate.

**hibernate.jdbc.batch_size**
This is an important setting which tells hibernate to enable batching of statements and configures the batch size used by hibernate.

**hibernate.order_inserts** and **hibernate.order_updates**
By default hibernate executes each statement in the same order it appears. However it affects the batching. Batching can target one table at a time.
As soon as a DML statement for a different table is encountered, it ends the current batch. This can result in hibernate not being able to use batching effectively.
The above two settings tells hibernate to order inserts and update statements respectively based on entity type.

**hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data**
This setting tells hibernate to enable batching for versioned entities and is required to enable batching of update statements.

**Note** from hibernate
>Some JDBC drivers return incorrect row counts when a batch is executed. If your JDBC driver falls into this category this setting should be set to false. Otherwise, it is safe to enable this which will allow Hibernate to still batch the DML for versioned entities and still use the returned row counts for optimistic lock checks. Since 5.0, it defaults to true. Previously (versions 3.x and 4.x), it used to be false.

**Caveats**
- Hibernate disables insert batching at the JDBC level transparently if you use an identity identifier generator. identity is often the default if nothing is set in Gorm
- Hibernate disables batch insert when using hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache = true

### Optimum setting for Gpars pool size.

It is observed that 4 or 5 cores gave the best results for [i7-4870HQ](https://ark.intel.com/products/83504) which has four(4) physical cores and shows 8 with Hyper threading. 

Gpars does not seem to benefit if it is given 8 cores when there are just four physical cores and four virtual cores.

The default Gpars pool size is Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() + 1
see [here](https://github.com/vaclav/GPars/blob/master/src/main/groovy/groovyx/gpars/util/PoolUtils.java#L43)
But since the hyper-threading shows 8 cores **this needs to be overriden manually on such systems**

As per Gpars performance tips [here](http://www.gpars.org/1.0.0/guide/guide/tips.html)
> In many scenarios changing the pool size from the default value may give you performance benefits. Especially if your tasks perform IO operations, like file or database access, networking and such, increasing the number of threads in the pool is likely to help performance.

## Second level cache

### Overview
By default Second level cache is disabled for benchmarks. To enable it we should use the 'secondLevelCache' system property.

For example: `java -server -jar -DmultiplyData=3 -Dgorm.tools.async.poolSize=1 -DsecondLevelCache=true build/libs/benchmarks.war`

`./run-benchmarks.sh` script by default starts benchmarks without Second Level Cache.
It contains the "Running benchmarks with Second Level cache" section with commented out configuration,
which can be used to run benchmarks with Second Level Cache.
Uncomment the next line in the script to run benchmarks with Second Level cache:

```
java -server -jar -DmultiplyData=3 -Dgorm.tools.async.poolSize=5 -DsecondLevelCache=true build/libs/benchmarks.war
```

  **Note**: Changing caching strategy can affect benchmark results

#### Caching strategies

- **read-only**: Useful for data that is read frequently but never updated (e.g. referential data like Countries). It has the best performances of all.
- **read-write**: Desirable if your data needs to be updated. But it doesn't provide a SERIALIZABLE isolation level, phantom reads can occur (you may see at the end of a transaction something that wasn't there at the start). It has more overhead than read-only.
- **nonstrict-read-write**: Alternatively, if it's unlikely two separate transaction threads could update the same object, you may use the nonstrict–read–write strategy. It has less overhead than read-write. This one is useful for data that are rarely updated.
- **transactional**: If you need a fully transactional cache. Only suitable in a JTA environment.
See Grails [Caching strategy]{.new-tab} and [Hiberante Second Level cache]{.new-tab} docs for more information

Using 'cacheStrategy' system property we can specify the caching strategy for all domains.
The default caching strategy is 'read-write'.
For example:
`java -server -jar -DmultiplyData=3 -Dgorm.tools.async.poolSize=1 -DsecondLevelCache=true -DcacheStrategy='read-write' build/libs/benchmarks.war `

#### EhCache configuration

We use [EhCache]{.new-tab} as the implementation for Second Level cache.
Grails documentation has not much information about configuring EhCache.
By default EhCache uses it's own configuration for cache (e.g. max elements in memory, etc).
**Note** that there might be issues with benchmark results when the max number of records in
default EhCache config is less that the number of records are used in a benchmark.
Due to this fact it is highly critical to have appropriate cache size (it depends on data amount),
we have defined custom configuration for EhCache in the `benchmarks/grails-app/conf/ehcache.xml` file.
Here is the example of custom `ehcache.xml` file:

  ```
  <ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../config/ehcache.xsd">
      <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>
      <defaultCache
              maxElementsInMemory="50000"
              overflowToDisk="false"
              maxElementsOnDisk="0"
      >
      </defaultCache>
  </ehcache>
  ```

`maxElementsInMemory` defines maximum number of elements in memory

`overflowToDisk` defines if data should be saved to disk in case if maximum number of elements in memory is reached

For more information see docs for [EhCache Configuration]{.new-tabs}

#### Using MySQL database.

In case of using MySQL database instead of H2, the performance impact from using Second level cache
can be better seen in benchmark results.
To be able to use MySQL database please uncomment config for dataSource in
```
../benchmarks/conf/application.yml
```
and dependency for the mysql connector in `../benchmarks/build.gradle` and change default production environment config.

Tested with MySQL 5.7.20.

### Benchmarks for Second Level Cache

* Next benchmarks were launched on the PC - Intel® Core™ i5-6600 CPU @ 3.30GHz × 4; 16 GiB RAM; Ubuntu 16.04 64bit

* Benchmark results for insert operations with- and without- Second Level Cache.

**Note:** An attempt to update an entity with ```read-only``` caching strategy
        will produce the exception with message "Cannot make an immutable entity modifiable"

**Results of the benchmark for **read** operations for different databases and caching strategies**

  The benchmark reads all the records once at the beginning to save them to cache
  (records will be added to second level cache only after the first read).
  Then it reads the same records in multiple threads at the same time.
  **Each thread reads all records - 37230 records. As a result (37230 * numberOfThreads) will be read.**
  This is done to simulate work of multiple users, that interact with the same data.

**Results of the benchmark for **update** operations for different databases and caching strategies.
  Firstly, this benchmark reads all the records (37k) at the beginning to save them to Second level cache.
  Then it updates records using pool of threads and splits 37k between threads**

**Conclusions**

  1. According to benchmarks there is no benefit or significant hit when using Second Level cache with insert operations.
     The results of the tests are ambiguous and in most cases show the worst performance when using Second level cache.
     There is an option to disable cache for the current session by adding ignore cache property.
     For example, ```session.setCacheMode(CacheMode.IGNORE)```. See [Disable cache for a session]{.new-tab} article.
  2. Second Level Cache makes sense for read operations.
     It significantly improves the performance of read operations when the data is not changing.
  3. Second level cache also makes sense for update operations, because updates use read to get required entities.

## Conclusions

The key conclusions Are as below

1. Gpars with batch insert is the optimum way to do large batch inserts.
2. Grails Databinding has BIG (10-20x slower) performance penalty and an even bigger hit when using Traits for fields on the domain.
   See [grails issue #10862](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/10862)
3. Inserting each record in seperate transaction has a BIG performance penalty and should be avoided when updating or inserting data.
5. use small transaction batches (100-255 items) and keep them the same size as the jdbc.batch_size. DO NOT (auto)commit on every insert
7. Disabling validation improves performance slightly and performs well eg. ```domain.save(false)```
8. Grails Date stamp fields has a negligible effect on performance.
9. AuditTrail stamp affects performance (see below for details)
10. Did not see any noticeable difference if Domain autowiring is enabled or disabled. (Domain with dependency on one service).
11. Dao does not have any major noticable effect on performance.
12. Disabling validation has slight performance benifits but not significant (see below for details)
13. Using custom [idgenerator](https://yakworks.github.io/gorm-tools/id-generation/) improves greatly over auto
   as it allows hibernate to use the jdbc.batch_size. see links above
14. Using listeners and grails @Listener events slows it down a bit. With out specs about 3 seconds for synchronous single thread processing 100k+ records.
   which drops to <1 second when doing the same thing asyncronously (gpars parralel batches)
15. From above table, it can be seen that
    * Going from 2 cores to 4 improves numbers significantly
    * Going from 4 cores to 8 numbers either degrades or improves only slightly on an intel 4 core with hyper-threading simulating 8 cores
    * from pool size 9 onward, performance defintely starts degrading as expected with threads fighting for resources.
16. set grails.gorm.autowire=false, its about 10% faster for saving. 

### Questions answered by above conclusion.

**Fastest way to persist/insert large batches using gorm**
Gpars batch insert without data binding and validation.

**Does binding slow it down, why, can it be optimized, best alternative**
- Yes, databinding has huge overhead on performance
- The overhead is caused by iterating over each property of the domain for every instance that needs to be bind, 
  calling type conversion system and other stuff done by GrailsWebDataBinder.
- Don't use databinding if you don't need to. Otherwise use the fast EntityMapBinder here. 

**Does grails.gorm.autowire=true slow it down**
- Yes, by anywhere from 5% to 15%

**Does validation slow it down, why, can it be optimized**
- Yes, it has slight performance impact
- That is because Grails validation (GrailsDomainClassValidator) has to iterate over each constrained property of domain class
  and invoke validators on it for every instance.

**Does Auditstamp slow it down, can it be optimized**
- Not significantly. Barely noticable as in 2-3%
- Thats because audit trail plugin hooks into validation and gets called every time when the domain is validated.
  It does some reflection to check for properties/value and checks in hibernate persistence context if the instance is being inserted or being updated. All this makes it little slower.
- Need to try what can be done in audit trail plugin to improve performance.

**Do daos slow it down**
- No, very little effect, some thing around 1 to 1.5 seconds for 115K records.

**Do custom Id generator slow it down, or improves speed**
- The batch id generator provided by Dao plugin improves the performance **significantly***.

**Do using Dataflow queue/operator make it faster**
- No, it has no noticeable effect

**Does @compileStatic speed things up**
- YES, significantly. compile static improves the performance as method calls are not intercepted and does not go through the metaclass.
- Putting CompileStatic on domain class improves the databinding speed.
- It is recommended to use compile static on services, domain classes and other code as far as possible, 
  unless the code need to use dynamic dispatch.
