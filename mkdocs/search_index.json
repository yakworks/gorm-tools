Used a a place logic to validate, bind, persist and query data that resides \neither in a database or NoSql (via GORM usually of course).\nThe design pattern here is a bit similiar to \nSpring's Repository pattern\n\nand Grails GORM's new \nData Services\n pattern.\n\n\nGoals\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\n: a clean common pattern across our apps for domain service layer logic that \n  reduces boiler plate in both services as well as controllers.\n\n\nTransactional Saves\n: every save() or persist() is wrapped in a transaction if one doesn't already exist. \n  This is critical when there are cascading saves and updates.\n\n\nRuntimeException Rollback by default\n: saves or \npersist()\n always occur with failOnError:true so a RuntimeException is \n  thrown for both DataAccessExceptions as well a validation exceptions.\n  This is critical for deeply nested domain logic dealing with saving multiple domains chains.\n\n\nEvents & Validation\n: the Repository allows a central place to do events such as beforeSave, beforeValidate, etc \n  so as not to pollute the domain class. This pattern makes it easier to keeps the special logic in a transaction as well. \n  Allows validation outside of constraints to persistence without needing to modify the domain source.\n\n\nEvents with Flushing\n: As mentioned in the Gorm docs, \"Do not attempt to flush the session within an event \n  (such as with obj.save(flush:true)). Since events are fired during flushing this will cause a StackOverflowError.\". \n  Putting the event business logic in the Repository keeps it all in a normal transaction and a flush is perfectly fine.  \n\n\nEasy Override/Replace Plugin's Domain Logic\n: Since the Repository is a service this also easily allows default logic in a provided \n  plugin to be overriden in an application. For example, I may have a CustomerRepo in a plugin that deals with deault common \n  logic to validate address. I can then implement a CustomerRepo in an application and it will override the spring bean\n  just as it does for a service. \n\n\n\n\nFast Data Binder & Batch Insert/Update\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe process millions of transactions per day and needed more performant binding performance.\n\n\nGoals\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nFAST Data Binding Service\n: databinding from maps (and thus JSON) has to be fast. \n  We sacrfice a small amount of functionality for a big performance gain\n  Maps and json are a first class citizen in the data service layer instead of the controller layer. \n  Eliminates boiler plate in getting data from the database to Gorm to JSON Map then back again.\n\n\nAsynchronous batch processing PERFORMANCE\n: GORM insert and updates can be chunked and processed in parrallel \n  using GPARS or RxJava making it easy to processes millions of records from JSON, CSV or Excel\n\n\n\n\nJSON Query and Filtering (Mango Query)\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe primary motive here is to create an easy dynamic map based way to query any Gorm Datastore (SQL or NoSQL). \nUsing a simple map that can come from json, yaml, groovy config etc... \nA huge motivating factor being able is to be able to have a powerful and flexible way to query using json from a REST \nbased client without having to use \nGraphQL\n (the only other clean alternative)\nThe Repositories and RestApiController come with a \nquery(criteriaMap, closure)\n method. It allows you to get a paginated \nlist of entities restricted by the properties in the \ncriteriaMap\n.\n\n\n\n\nA lot of inspiration was drawn from \nRestdb.io\n\n\nthe query language is similar to \nMongo's\n\n\nand CouchDB's new \nMango selector-syntax\n .\n\n\nAlso inspired by \njson-sql\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhilst selectors have many similarities with MongoDB query documents, \nthese arise more from a similarity of purpose and do not necessarily extend to commonality of function or result.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nfor example, sending a JSON search param that looks like this\n\n\n{\n\n  \n\"name\"\n:\n \n\"Bill%\"\n,\n\n  \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"New\"\n,\n\n  \n\"age\"\n:\n \n{\n\"$gt\"\n:\n \n65\n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nwould get converted to the equivalent criteria\n\n\ncriteria\n.\nlist\n \n{\n\n    \nilike\n \n\"name\"\n,\n \n\"Bill%\"\n\n    \neq\n \n\"type\"\n,\n \n\"New\"\n\n    \ngt\n \n\"age\"\n,\n \n65\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Notes\n\u00b6\n\n\nMake\n\u00b6\n\n\nwhile gradle is the build tool behind spring/grails, make is used for consitency to run gradle\nand use docker and setting up env for testing\n\n\nrun \nmake\n to see help\n\n\nrun \nmake check\n for full tests\n\n\nor run \n./gradlew check\n\n\nRunning docs locally\n\u00b6\n\n\nrun make help for latest targets\n\n\nmake docmark.start\n\n\nPublishing Plugin Releases\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee \nDeveloper Docs\n for info on our release process\n\n\nUsing latests SNAPSHOT\n  \n\n\nConfigure 9ci repo in build.gradle\n\n\nrepositories\n \n{\n\n  \nmaven\n \n{\n \nurl\n \n\"http://repo.9ci.com/oss-snapshots\"\n \n}\n\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nversion.properties\n for snapshot version\n\n\ndependencies\n \n{\n\n \ncompile\n(\n'org.grails.plugins:gorm-tools:x.y.z-SNAPSHOT'\n)\n \n{\n \nchanging\n \n=\n \ntrue\n \n}\n \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDocs Links\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nDOCS ARE REALLY OUT OF DATE AND BEING UPDATED FOR BREAKING CHANGES after 6.1.12-v.X\n\n\nALSO MERGING IN DOCS FOR THE REST-API AND AUDITSTAMP THAT WAS MERGED INTO HERE\n\nMore breaking changes in 7.0.8-v6. is required on domain entity now or it needs to implement @GormRepoEntity\n\n\n\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuide\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased Docs\n\n\nReleased Api\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsnapshot\n\n\nsnapshot",

The first comes a name of a domain class, for which an event\nis created and the second - a type of a specific repository event. For example, in case we call \npersist()\n method\non a domain entity called \nOrg\n, the repository invokes several events, one of them is BeforePersist event with id \nOrg.beforePersist\n.\n\n\nSubscribing to events\n\u00b6\n\n\nGrails provides several options for handling events, please see Grails docs for \nEvent Handling\n.\n\n\nIn case of adding \n@Subscriber\n annotation to a method, Grails determines event id from the method name\nby default. For example, methods like \nsomeEvent()\n or \nonSomeEvent()\n listen to the event with id \nsomeEvent\n.\n\n\nDue to the fact that ids of repository events contain \n.\n symbol, we should pass event id to the Subscriber annotation like so:\n\n\n    \n@Subscriber\n(\n\"SomeDomain.someEvent\"\n)\n\n    \nvoid\n \nsomeMethod\n()\n \n{}\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Grails docs, a class which contains a listener method (with \n@Subscriber\n annotation) should be a \nspring bean\n.\n\n\nPlease see the example with \nOrgSubscriber\n below:\n\n\nExample\n\n\nimport\n \ngrails.events.annotation.Subscriber\n\n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent\n\n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.AfterPersistEvent\n\n\n\nclass\n \nOrgSubscriber\n \n{\n\n\n    \n@Subscriber\n(\n\"Org.beforePersist\"\n)\n\n    \nvoid\n \nbeforePersist\n(\nBeforePersistEvent\n \nevent\n)\n \n{\n\n       \n// ...\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n@Subscriber\n(\n\"Org.afterPersist\"\n)\n\n    \nvoid\n \nafterPersist\n(\nAfterPersistEvent\n \nevent\n)\n \n{\n\n       \n// ...\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example we can see two listeners which handle events that occur before and after\npersisting an entity of the Org domain class.\n\n\nSpring Events\n\u00b6\n\n\nSpring events are recomended over grails.events as they are much more performant if processing large numbers of domains\nThe Repository also publishes a number of \n\nevents as listed in the Groovydoc API\n\n\nExample\n\n\nimport\n \norg.springframework.context.event.EventListener\n\n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.BeforeBindEvent\n\n\n\nclass\n \nOrgListener\n \n{\n\n\n    \n@EventListener\n\n    \nvoid\n \nbeforeBind\n(\nBeforeBindEvent\n<\nOrg\n>\n \nevent\n)\n \n{\n\n       \nOrg\n \norg\n \n=\n \nevent\n.\nentity\n\n       \n//Do some thing here.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCalling methods which trigger events inside an event listener causes an infinite loop\n\n\n\n\nExternal refreshable beans for Events\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince 2.0 Spring added support for defining beans using supported dynamic languages. Eg. groovy. \nThis makes it possible to create groovy script files outside of application which contains class definition, and use it as spring bean.\nThis feature can be used to create refreshable beans, spring will watch the external script for changes and automatically reload the bean if it has changed.\nThe interval can be configured using \nrefresh-check-delay\n. This feature makes it possible to externalize the event listeners outside of application.\n\n\nHere is an example of how to use an external refreshable bean as event listener. \n\n\nCreate a groovy script containing bean definition for event listener some where on file system out side of grails application directory.\n\n\nFile\n \nOrgEventListener.groovy\n\n\nimport\n \ngrails.events.annotation.Subscriber\n\n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent\n\n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.AfterPersistEvent\n\n\n\npublic\n \nclass\n \nOrgEventListener\n \n{\n\n\n      \n@Subscriber\n(\n\"Org.beforePersist\"\n)\n\n      \nvoid\n \nbeforePersist\n(\nBeforePersistEvent\n \ne\n){\n\n          \nOrg\n \norg\n \n=\n \n(\nOrg\n)\n \ne\n.\nentity\n\n          \n//do some thing with org\n\n      \n}\n\n\n      \n@Subscriber\n(\n\"Org.afterPersist\"\n)\n\n      \nvoid\n \nafterPersist\n(\nAfterPersistEvent\n \ne\n){\n\n          \nOrg\n \norg\n \n=\n \n(\nOrg\n)\n \ne\n.\nentity\n\n          \n//do some thing with org\n\n      \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above example uses \nSubscriber\n annotation from \nGrails async\n project. The event handler methods will get called asynchronously and does not take part in transaction.\nRepository also publishes events using spring event mechanism which can be used to define event listeners which gets called synchronously and takes part in current transaction. \n\n\nFollowing example shows how to define synchronous event listener.\n\n\nimport\n \norg.springframework.context.ApplicationListener\n \n\nimport\n \ngorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent\n\n\n\nclass\n \nOrgEventListener\n \nimplements\n \nApplicationListener\n<\nBeforePersistEvent\n<\nOrg\n>>\n  \n{\n\n\n    \nvoid\n \nonApplicationEvent\n(\nBeforePersistEvent\n<\nOrg\n>\n \nevent\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nOrg\n \norg\n \n=\n \nevent\n.\nentity\n\n        \n//dome some thing with org.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n \n\n\n\n\nDefine \nOrgEventListener\n as spring bean in \ngrails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy\n\n\n \nxmlns\n \nlang:\n \n\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang\"\n\n \nlang\n.\ngroovy\n(\nid:\n \n\"orgEventListener\"\n,\n \n'script-source'\n:\n \n\"file:<path to OrgEventListener.groovy>\"\n,\n \n'refresh-check-delay'\n:\n \n1000\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the \nrefreshableBean\n can be injected into any other bean.

In case of adding  @Subscriber  annotation to a method, Grails determines event id from the method name\nby default. For example, methods like  someEvent()  or  onSomeEvent()  listen to the event with id  someEvent .  Due to the fact that ids of repository events contain  .  symbol, we should pass event id to the Subscriber annotation like so:       @Subscriber ( \"SomeDomain.someEvent\" ) \n     void   someMethod ()   {}   According to Grails docs, a class which contains a listener method (with  @Subscriber  annotation) should be a  spring bean .  Please see the example with  OrgSubscriber  below:  Example  import   grails.events.annotation.Subscriber  import   gorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent  import   gorm.tools.repository.events.AfterPersistEvent  class   OrgSubscriber   { \n\n     @Subscriber ( \"Org.beforePersist\" ) \n     void   beforePersist ( BeforePersistEvent   event )   { \n        // ... \n     } \n\n     @Subscriber ( \"Org.afterPersist\" ) \n     void   afterPersist ( AfterPersistEvent   event )   { \n        // ... \n     }  }  \nIn this example we can see two listeners which handle events that occur before and after\npersisting an entity of the Org domain class.",

Eg. groovy. \nThis makes it possible to create groovy script files outside of application which contains class definition, and use it as spring bean.\nThis feature can be used to create refreshable beans, spring will watch the external script for changes and automatically reload the bean if it has changed.\nThe interval can be configured using  refresh-check-delay . This feature makes it possible to externalize the event listeners outside of application.  Here is an example of how to use an external refreshable bean as event listener.   Create a groovy script containing bean definition for event listener some where on file system out side of grails application directory.  File   OrgEventListener.groovy  import   grails.events.annotation.Subscriber  import   gorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent  import   gorm.tools.repository.events.AfterPersistEvent  public   class   OrgEventListener   { \n\n       @Subscriber ( \"Org.beforePersist\" ) \n       void   beforePersist ( BeforePersistEvent   e ){ \n           Org   org   =   ( Org )   e . entity \n           //do some thing with org \n       } \n\n       @Subscriber ( \"Org.afterPersist\" ) \n       void   afterPersist ( AfterPersistEvent   e ){ \n           Org   org   =   ( Org )   e . entity \n           //do some thing with org \n       }  }   The above example uses  Subscriber  annotation from  Grails async  project. The event handler methods will get called asynchronously and does not take part in transaction.\nRepository also publishes events using spring event mechanism which can be used to define event listeners which gets called synchronously and takes part in current transaction.   Following example shows how to define synchronous event listener.  import   org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener   import   gorm.tools.repository.events.BeforePersistEvent  class   OrgEventListener   implements   ApplicationListener < BeforePersistEvent < Org >>    { \n\n     void   onApplicationEvent ( BeforePersistEvent < Org >   event )   { \n         Org   org   =   event . entity \n         //dome some thing with org. \n     }  }    Define  OrgEventListener  as spring bean in  grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy    xmlns   lang:   \"http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang\" \n  lang . groovy ( id:   \"orgEventListener\" ,   'script-source' :   \"file:<path to OrgEventListener.groovy>\" ,   'refresh-check-delay' :   1000 )   Now the  refreshableBean  can be injected into any other bean.

Restrictions for it are working in the same way as for query method, so it can be specified \nwith params map and criteria closure.\n\n\nBut the repository beans don't contain this method, so one can call it on mangoQuery bean.\nTo specify what fields sums should be computed for, the list with fields name should be passed.\nSee example:\n\nOrg\n.\nrepo\n.\nmangoQuery\n.\ncountTotals\n(\ndomainClass\n,\n \n[\n\n  \ncriteria:\n \n[\nname:\n \n\"Virgin%\"\n,\n \ntype:\n \n\"New\"\n]\n\n\n],\n \n[\n\"amount\"\n,\n \ncredit\n]){\n\n  \ngt\n \n\"id\"\n,\n \n5\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nResult will be look like: \n[amount: 1500, credit: 440]\n, it doesn't take into account pagination.\n\n\nScrollableQuery\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee \nScrollableQuery\n\n\nExecute a closure for each record\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs you can see in the example below, we can specify the SQL query and provide the closure which is called for each record:\n\n\n    \nScrollableQuery\n \nscrollableQuery\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nScrollableQuery\n(\nnew\n \nColumnMapRowMapper\n(),\n \ndataSource\n,\n \n50\n)\n\n\n    \nscrollableQuery\n.\neachRow\n(\n\"select * from ScrollableQueryTest\"\n)\n \n{\n \nObject\n \nrow\n \n->\n\n        \nprintln\n \nrow\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute a closure for each batch of records\n\u00b6\n\n\nUsing \neachBatch\n we can execute a closure for a batch of records.\nThis closure is called for a specified number of records. For example, code below prints size of each batch\n(which is 5) to console:\n\n\n    \nscrollableQuery\n.\neachBatch\n(\n\"select * from ScrollableQueryTest\"\n,\n \n5\n)\n \n{\n \nList\n \nbatch\n \n->\n\n        \nprintln\n \n\"batchSize=${batch.size()}\"\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching a list of all records:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n This method holds all rows in memory, so this should not be used if there is going to be large number of rows.\n\n\n\n\n    \nList\n \nvalues\n \n=\n \nscrollableQuery\n.\nrows\n(\n\"select * from ScrollableQueryTest where value='test'\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nPathKeyMapRowMapper\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee \nPathKeyMapRowMapper\n\n\nRow mapper which allows to convert data from a given ResultSet instance\nto a grails parameter map, which can be used for databinding.",

It also keeps it easy to configure and customize on the fly at a deployed client site without the need to recompile.  While its somewhat opinionated it frames out Rest best practices outlined in the [Rest Design Principles] section.  It uses the  OpenAPI  spec (formerly  Swagger ) as well as how it maps the Gorm domains into that spec. Its accepts and returns only JSON and eschews the complexity of XML  While REST is not CRUD a lot of it really is. This project aims to makes it easy and quick to setup the common use cases that are really just CRUD Controller over the [GORM] domains so you can focus on the unique business logic use cases that are hard.  Key features and goals of this plugin include:   The simple stuff should be simple and automatic  DRY : Don't repeat yourself.  Autogenerated code is evil. This includes tests  Use AST, traits and tanspiling where possible      Near zero configuration to expose  Swagger  documented resources (the Gorm domains)   Rely on the domain's contraints as much as possible for configurations and docs.   Out of the box CRUD Controller modified from Grails  @Resource annotation and RestfulController  \n      that can delegate to transactional Services (Repositories, Data Services) flavored services based on naming \n      convention or configuration. Uses the [gorm-tools] plugin by deafault for this.   Custom schema selects for retruned JSON fields that can be confiugured at runtime by a customer (does not require recompiling views)   Consistent documented use of HTTP status codes and headers   Uses  cache-headers  for faster loading   Use [Repository] pattern by defualt to keep the CRUD code in its own transactional service   Ability to 'query by POST' (to allow query criteria to be provided within the request body)   Intelligent defaults for security plugin with OATH and JWT.

One is to change the default time zone of JVM using \nTimeZone.setDefault( TimeZone.getTimeZone( \"UTC\" ) );\n\nHowever this forces to change the jvm default time zone which may not be possible in all cases.\n\n\nAnother option is to use the hibernate setting \nhibernamte.jdbc.time_zone\n\n\nWith grails, the timezone which hibernate uses can be configured in \napplication.yml\n as shown below.\n\n\nhibernate\n:\n\n    \njdbc\n:\n\n      \ntime_zone\n:\n \nUTC\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will instruct hibernate to store and retrieve the dates in UTC timezone.\n\n\nHowever it should be noted that if you query the date values with JDBC it will be retrieved in JVM timezone and not UTC and will need to be converted to UTC manually or use the overloaded version of ResultSet.getTimeStamp that takes calendar as second argument\nEg. \nResultSet#getTimestamp(int columnIndex, Calendar cal)\n\n\nReferences on this\n\u00b6\n\n\nhttp://in.relation.to/2016/09/12/jdbc-time-zone-configuration-property/\n\n\nhttps://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11396\n\n\nhttps://vladmihalcea.com/2017/03/14/how-to-store-date-time-and-timestamps-in-utc-time-zone-with-jdbc-and-hibernate/\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31965179/whats-new-in-hibernate-orm-5",

One is to change the default time zone of JVM using  TimeZone.setDefault( TimeZone.getTimeZone( \"UTC\" ) ); \nHowever this forces to change the jvm default time zone which may not be possible in all cases.  Another option is to use the hibernate setting  hibernamte.jdbc.time_zone  With grails, the timezone which hibernate uses can be configured in  application.yml  as shown below.  hibernate : \n     jdbc : \n       time_zone :   UTC   This will instruct hibernate to store and retrieve the dates in UTC timezone.  However it should be noted that if you query the date values with JDBC it will be retrieved in JVM timezone and not UTC and will need to be converted to UTC manually or use the overloaded version of ResultSet.getTimeStamp that takes calendar as second argument\nEg.
